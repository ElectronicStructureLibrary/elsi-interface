  ABOUT ELSI
============================================================================

  ELSI provides and enhances open-source software solutions for electronic
  structure theory with unified application programming interface.

  ELSI focuses on methods that solve or circumvent the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue
  problems in the Self-Consistent Field cycle of Density-Functional Theory.

  INSTALLATION OF ELSI
===========================================================================

  The standard installation process of ELSI requires:

  * A Fortran compiler
  * C/C++ compilers
  * An MPI library
  * LAPACK and ScaLAPACK
  * ParMetis 4.0.3
    (available at http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/parmetis/overview)
  * SuperLU_DIST 5.1.2 or 5.1.3
    (available at http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU)

  All major compiler suites (GNU, Intel, PGI, XL, and Cray) are supported.

  The compilation process is: 

  * make
  * make check (optional, requires TOMATO. See ./INSTALL)
  * make install

  Instead of the standard *nix "configure" step, the user specifies their
  system environment via flags set in a "make.sys" file, which should be 
  placed in the root directory of ELSI alongside the Makefile. Some example
  "make.sys" files that the user may adapt for their own system environment
  are available in the "./make_sys" folder.

  Please refer to the "INSTALL" file for the complete installation process.
