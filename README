  INSTALLATION OF ELSI
===========================================================================

  The standard installation process of ELSI requires:

  * A Fortran 2003 compiler
  * A C compiler supporting the C99 standard
  * A C++ compiler supporting the C++11 standard
  * An MPI library
  * LAPACK and ScaLAPACK
  * ParMetis 4.0.3
    (available at http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/parmetis/overview)
  * SuperLU_DIST 5.1.2 or 5.1.3
    (available at http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU)

  All major compiler suites (GNU, Intel, PGI, XL, and Cray) are supported.

  The user specifies their system environment via flags set in a "make.sys"
  file, which should be placed in the root directory of ELSI alongside the
  Makefile. Some example "make.sys" files that the user may adapt for their
  own system environment are available in the "./make_sys" folder.

  The compilation process is:

  * make
  * make check (optional, requires TOMATO. See ./INSTALL)
  * make install

  Please refer to the "INSTALL" file for the complete installation process.
