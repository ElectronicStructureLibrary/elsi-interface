		SuperLU_DIST  EXAMPLES
		======================

This directory contains sample programs to illustrate how to use
various functions provded in SuperLU_DIST. You can modify these
examples to suit your applications.

The examples illustrate the following functionalities:
  1. pddrive.c, pddrive_ABglobal.c
     Use PDGSSVX with the full (default) options to solve a linear system.
  2. pddrive1.c, pddrive1_ABglobal.c
     Solve the systems with same A but different right-hand side.
     (Reuse the factored form of A)
  3. pddrive2.c, pddrive2_ABglobal.c
     Solve the systems with the same sparsity pattern of A.
     (Reuse the sparsity ordering)
  4. pddrive3.c, pddrive3_ABglobal.c
     Solve the systems with the same sparsity pattern and similar values.
  5. pddrive4.c, pddrive4_ABglobal.c
     Divide the processors into two subgroups (two grids) such that each
     subgroup solves a linear system independently from the other.


The command line options "-r <process rows>" and "-c <process columns>"
defines the 2-D process grid. The total number of processes <procs> is:
	<procs> = <process rows> * <process columns>
If the options is not provided at the command line, the programs
will use 1 processor as default in each case.

Three input matrices (Harwell-Boeing format) are provided in this directory:
	g20.rua  -- a real matrix of dimension 400x400
	big.rua  -- a real matrix of dimension 4960x4960
        cg20.cua -- a complex matrix of dimension 400x400

The command lines given below show how to run the parallel programs on the
Cray XT using "aprun". On the other platforms, you may need other
command in place of "aprun".

1. To run the real examples (pddrive, pddrive1, etc.)
   you may type:
   % aprun -n <np> pddrive -r <process row> -c <process columns> g20.rua 
     (e.g., aprun -n 4 pddrive -r 2 -c 2 g20.rua)

2. To run the real examples pddrive4 and pddrive4_ABglobal, you may type:
   % aprun -n 10 pddrive4 g20.rua
   
3. To run the complex examples (pzdrive, pzdrive1, etc.),
   you may type:
   % aprun -n <np> pzdrive -r <process row> -c <process columns> cg20.cua

4. To run the complex examples pzdrive4 and pzdrive4_ABglobal, you may type:
   % aprun -n 10 pzdrive4 cg20.rua
