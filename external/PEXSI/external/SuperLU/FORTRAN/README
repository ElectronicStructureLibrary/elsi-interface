		Fortran 90 Interface

This directory contains Fortran-90 wrapper routines for SuperLU_DIST.
The directory contains the following files:
    superlu_mod.f90    -  Fortran 90 module that defines the wrapper functions
                             to access SuperLU_DIST's data structures.
    superlupara.f90    -  It contains parameters that correspond to
                             SuperLU_DIST's enumerate constants.
    superlu_c2f_wrap.c -  All the C wrapper functions, callable from Fortran.
    hbcode1.f90        -  Fortran routine to read a Harwell-Boeing matrix.

To compile the code, type 'make'

There are two examples in the directory.

1. f_5x5.f90:
   A small 5x5 example appeared in the SuperLU Users Guide, Section 2.2.
   To run the code on a Cray XT or XE, type 'aprun -n 2 f_5x5'
   (The example is set up to use 2 processors.)

2. f_pddrive.f90 / f_pzdrive.f90:
   An example Fortran driver routine that reads a matrix from a file
   'g20.rua' in Harwell-Boeing format.
   To run the code on a Cray XT or XE, type 'aprun -n 4 f_pddrive'
   (The example is set up to use 4 processors.)

   The complex version:
   % aprun -n 4 f_pzdrive
