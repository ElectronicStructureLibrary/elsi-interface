Description
-----------

MatrixSwitch is a module which acts as an intermediary interface layer between high-level routines for physics-related algorithms and low-level routines dealing with matrix storage and manipulation. This allows the high-level routines to be written in a way which is physically transparent, and enables them to switch seamlessly between different software implementations of the matrix operations.

Installation
------------

1.  Enter the `src` directory.
2.  Copy `make.inc.example` to `make.inc` and modify it to suit your needs. Available options for `FPPFLAGS` are:
    * `-DMPI`: enable MPI parallel routines
    * `-DLAP`: enable LAPACK routines
    * `-DSLAP`: enable ScaLAPACK routines (requires MPI)
    * `-DCONV`: enable automatic conversion of scalar types (real/complex) to agree with matrix definitions (real/complex). Note that conversions from complex to real will simply discard the imaginary part.
3.  Type `make`.

Testing
-------

The `examples` directory contains a number of small programs that make use of MatrixSwitch. These can be useful both for testing the installation and for learning how to use the library. To compile them:

1.   Enter the `examples` directory.
2.   Copy `make.inc.example` to `make.inc` and modify it to suit your needs. Be aware that `make.inc` in the `src` directory will also be used.
3.   Type `make`.

Each example contains a header explaining what the program does and providing sample output to compare against.

Usage
-----

`MatrixSwitch` is a module that you can `use` in Fortran routines. Note that both the `.a` and `.mod` files need to be available. An example compilation command for a code using MatrixSwitch is: `gfortran MyCode.f90 /path/to/MatrixSwitch-x.y.z/src/MatrixSwitch.a -I/path/to/MatrixSwitch-x.y.z/src/ -llapack -lblas`
