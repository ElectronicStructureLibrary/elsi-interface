!>
!> \details
!> It is possible to configure ELPA2 such, that different compute intensive
!> "ELPA2 kernels" can be choosen at runtime.
!> The service binary print_available_elpa2_kernels will query the library and tell
!> whether ELPA2 has been configured in this way, and if this is the case which kernels can be
!> choosen at runtime.
!> It will furthermore detail whether ELPA has been configured with OpenMP support
