! This routine transposes an array of vectors which are distributed in
! communicator comm_s into its transposed form distributed in communicator comm_t.
! There must be an identical copy of vmat_s in every communicator comm_s.
! After this routine, there is an identical copy of vmat_t in every communicator comm_t.
!
! vmat_s    original array of vectors
! ld_s      leading dimension of vmat_s
! comm_s    communicator over which vmat_s is distributed
! vmat_t    array of vectors in transposed form
! ld_t      leading dimension of vmat_t
! comm_t    communicator over which vmat_t is distributed
! nvs       global index where to start in vmat_s/vmat_t
!           Please note: this is kind of a hint, some values before nvs will be
!           accessed in vmat_s/put into vmat_t
! nvr       global length of vmat_s/vmat_t
! nvc       number of columns in vmat_s/vmat_t
! nblk      block size of block cyclic distribution

   ! The basic idea of this routine is that for every block (in the block cyclic
   ! distribution), the processor within comm_t which owns the diagonal
   ! broadcasts its values of vmat_s to all processors within comm_t.

   ! the least common multiple of (nps,npt) blocks
