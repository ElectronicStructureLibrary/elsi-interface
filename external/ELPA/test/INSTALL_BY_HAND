How to install ELPA without the autotools
=========================================

If you are looking at this file, you may try to build ELPA by yourself, 
using the predefined makefile "Makefile.elsi". Please note that before 
you run "make -f Makefile.elsi", there are a few variables to set in 
the makefile.

1) Edit your Makefile.elsi

1.1) Choose ELPA2 kernels

   If using autotools to install ELPA, With the release 2014.06 or newer 
   it is NOT mandatory to define the (real and complex) kernels at build 
   time. The configure procedure will build all the kernels which can be 
   used on the build system. The choice of the kernels is now a run-time 
   option.

   However, without the autotools it is MANDATORY to define ONE specific 
   kernel (for the real and the complex case each). Then, ELPA is 
   configured only with this real (and complex) kernel, and all run-time 
   checking is disabled.

   The variable "ARCHITECTURE" in Makefile.elsi is used to specify ELPA2 
   kernels. See the file "./src/elpa2_kernels/README_elpa2_kernels".

1.2) Switch on/off OpenMP

   The variable "OPENMP" in Makefile.elsi is used to switch on/off OpenMP.
   Set this variable to "yes" or "no".

1.3) Set up Blacs/Scalapack

   The variable "SCALAPACK" in Makefile.elsi is used to specify the 
   location of your Blacs/Scalapack installation.

   For example with Intel MKL one might have to set

   SCALAPACK="-L${MKLROOT}/lib/intel64 -lmkl_scalapack_lp64 \
              -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_core \
              -lmkl_blacs_intelmpi_lp64 -lpthread -lm \

1.4) Set compilers with flags

   Please set the Fortran/C/C++ compilers that you prefer with the variables
   "MPIFC", "MPICC", and "MPICXX". Flags are set with the variables "FCFLAGS",
   "CCFLAGS", and "CXXFLAGS" respectively. 
   
   Note that C and C++ comlilers are only needed if AVX kernels and/or OpenMP
   are included. See "./src/elpa2_kernels/README_elpa2_kernels".

2) Run "make"

   Include the option "-f" to specify which makefile to use:

   make -f Makefile.elsi

3) Set environment variables for ELPA2 kernels

   Since this installation procedure does not support choosing ELPA2 kernels 
   with API, some environment variables have to be set, forcing the code to 
   use the appropriate kernels.

   The shell script "set_env.sh" is designed to set necessary environment 
   variables for the (real and complex) ELPA2 kernels. After Seting the 
   variable "ARCHITECTURE", run the script:

   . ./set_env.sh
