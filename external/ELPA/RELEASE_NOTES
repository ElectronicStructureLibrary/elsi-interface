This file contains the release notes for the ELPA 2015.02.001 version



What is new?
-------------

a) ABI change
---------------------

Most importantly, the ABI of the ELPA libray changed!
A rebuild/relink of the user code using the ELPA library is mandatory!
Hopefully, this will be the last ABI change for some time.

b) C interface
----------------------

ELPA now is shipped with a C interface to directly call the ELPA library (written in Fortran)
from C code. Header files are provided to declare the c functions.
Since ELPA is still a Fortran library it might be necessary to link it together with the needed
Fortran runtime libraries in your C code.



Any incompatibles to previous version?
---------------------------------------

As mentioned before, the ABI of ELPA has changed! It will be necessary
to rebuild the programs using ELPA, if this new version should be used.
Beware, using the new library with code which was build with an older verion
should not even run. If it does, the results will be wrong !
