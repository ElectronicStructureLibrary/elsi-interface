===================
   ELSI May 2018
===================

   ELSI:
   * CMake build system has replaced the Makefile-based system.
   * Support for spin channels and k-points has been added.
   * Support for energy-weighted density matrix has been added.
   * Support for electronic entropy calculation has been added.
   * Support for complex sparse matrix formats has been added for eigensolver
     and density matrix solver interfaces.
   * Mutator subroutines no longer use optional variables.
   * Matrix I/O subroutines using the MPI I/O standard have been added.
   * Removed ToMatO dependency for test suite.
   * Added a unified timing framework with JSON output via the FortJSON library.

   New Solvers:
   * SIPs added via external linkage.
   * (Experimental) CheSS added via external linkage.
   * (Experimental) Density matrix purification added.

   New Matrix Storage Formats:
   * Added 1D block-cyclic compressed sparse column (SIESTA_CSC format).

   ELPA:
   * Redistributed version updated to 2016.11.001.
   * AVX512 kernel has been added.
   * The two-stage solver is now the default solver for all matrix sizes.

   ELPA AEO:
   * The interface for externally linked ELPA has been updated to the AEO
     verison (release 2017.05 or later).  This enables a number of new features
     including:
   * Autotuning is enabled by default for externally linked ELPA.
   * The ability to run the first X ELSI invocations using single-precision
     ELPA, then switch to double-precision ELPA, has been added for externally
     linked ELPA.
   * GPU acceleration and GPU kernels may be enabled through the ELSI interface
     for externally linked ELPA.

   PEXSI:
   * Redistributed version updated to v1.0.
   * Default number of poles reduced to 20.
   * Switched to the PT-SCOTCH library as the default sparse matrix reordering
     software.
   * SuperLU_DIST 5.3.0 redistributed with ELSI.  Compiling SuperLU_DIST within
     ELSI requires that PT-SCOTCH be linked as an external dependency.
     (Alternatively, the user may provide their own SuperLU_DIST library linked
     against any compatible sparse matrix reordering library.)
   * Removed ParMETIS as a mandatory external dependency for PEXSI.
