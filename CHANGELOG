============================
   ELSI May 2018 (v2.0.2)
============================

   ELSI:
   * Downgraged redistributed (PT-)SCOTCH source code to version 6.0.0, as
     the 6.0.5a version may lead to random crashes on some platforms.

   PEXSI:
   * Updated redistributed PEXSI source code to version 1.0.1, which fixes
     the complex inertia counting routine.

============================
   ELSI May 2018 (v2.0.1)
============================

   ELSI:
   * Switched to the semantic versioning scheme (http://semver.org).
   * Fixed building ELSI as a shared library with tests enabled.
   * Improved stability when calling PBLAS routines pdtran and pztranc.

   Known Issue:
   * Depending on the choice of k-points, the complex PEXSI solver may fail
     at the inertia counting stage.

============================
   ELSI May 2018 (v2.0.0)
============================

   ELSI:
   * CMake build system has replaced the Makefile-based system.
   * Added support for building ELSI as a shared library.
   * Added support for spin channels and k-points.
   * Added support for energy-weighted density matrix.
   * Added support for electronic entropy calculations.
   * Added support for complex sparse matrix formats for eigensolver and
     density matrix solver interfaces.
   * Removed optional variables from mutator subroutines.
   * Added matrix I/O subroutines using the MPI I/O standard.
   * Removed TOMATO dependency for the test suite.
   * Added a unified JSON output framework via the FortJSON library.

   New Solvers:
   * Added support for the SLEPc-SIPs solver (PETSc 3.8.4 and SLEPc 3.8.3
     required)
   * (Experimental) Implemented density matrix purification with dense
     linear algebra operations.

   New Matrix Storage Format:
   * Added 1D block-cyclic compressed sparse column (SIESTA_CSC) format.

   ELPA:
   * Updated redistributed ELPA source code to version 2016.11.001.
   * Added AVX512 kernel.
   * Made the two-stage solver default for all matrix sizes.
   * Updated the interface for externally linked ELPA the AEO version
     (ELPA release 2017.05 or later).  GPU acceleration and GPU kernels
     may be enabled through the ELSI interface for externally linked ELPA.

   PEXSI:
   * Updated redistributed PEXSI source code to version 1.0.0.
   * Reduced the default number of poles to 20 without sacrificing
     accuracy.
   * Switched to the PT-SCOTCH library as the default sparse matrix
     reordering software.
   * Redistributed superLU_DIST 5.3.0 and (PT-)SCOTCH 6.0.5a libraries.
     The user may still provide their own SuperLU_DIST library linked
     against any compatible sparse matrix reordering library.
   * Removed ParMETIS as a mandatory external dependency for PEXSI.
