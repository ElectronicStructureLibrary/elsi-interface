===================
   ELSI May 2018
===================

   ELSI:
   * CMake build system has replaced the Makefile-based system.
   * Support for building ELSI as a shared library has been added.
   * Support for spin channels and k-points has been added.
   * Support for energy-weighted density matrix has been added.
   * Support for electronic entropy calculations has been added.
   * Support for complex sparse matrix formats has been added for
     eigensolver and density matrix solver interfaces.
   * Mutator subroutines no longer use optional variables.
   * Matrix I/O subroutines using the MPI I/O standard have been added.
   * Removed ToMatO dependency for test suite.
   * Added a unified JSON output framework via the FortJSON library.

   New Solvers:
   * SLEPc-SIPs added via external linkage.
   * (Experimental) Density matrix purification implemented with dense
     linear algebra operations.

   New Matrix Storage Formats:
   * Added 1D block-cyclic compressed sparse column (SIESTA_CSC format).

   ELPA:
   * Redistributed version updated to 2016.11.001.
   * AVX512 kernel has been added.
   * The two-stage solver is now the default solver for all matrix sizes.
   * The interface for externally linked ELPA has been updated to the AEO
     verison (release 2017.05 or later).  GPU acceleration and GPU kernels
     may be enabled through the ELSI interface for externally linked ELPA.

   PEXSI:
   * Redistributed version updated to v1.0.
   * Default number of poles reduced to 20.
   * Switched to the PT-SCOTCH library as the default sparse matrix
     reordering software.
   * SuperLU_DIST 5.3.0 and (PT-)SCOTCH 6.0.5a redistributed with ELSI.
     The user may still provide their own SuperLU_DIST library linked
     against any compatible sparse matrix reordering library.
   * Removed ParMETIS as a mandatory external dependency for PEXSI.
