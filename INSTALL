HOW TO INSTALL ELSI
===================

A) Install from zero: if you do not have any part of the ELSI package 
   installed before, you may choose this way to build everything for you.

1) Variables in the file "make.sys" control the process of installation.
   Edit this file to match your platform/environment.

1.1) Global settings
   Set the compilers, archive tools, and the location of BLAS, LAPACK, 
   BLACS, and ScaLAPACK. These will be used during the whole installation.

1.2) ELSI-interface
   Set the Fortran compiler flags and the location of HDF5.

1.3) ELPA
   Set the compiler flags, choose appropriate ELPA2 kernels according
   to the architecture of your facility, and switch on/off OpenMP.

1.4) libOMM
   Set the Fortran compiler flags and switch on/off MPI, LAPACK, and 
   ScaLAPACK.

1.5) PEXSI
   Set the location of Fortran library.

1.6) Library directories
   Since you do not have ELPA, libOMM, or PEXSI, please use the default 
   settings for this part.

2) PEXSI requires two external libraries: ParMETIS and SuperLU_DIST. 
   Run "make external" to build these libraries.

3) Make sure your "make.sys" is correctly configured. Then run "make" 
   to build ELPA, libOMM, PEXSI, and the ELSI interface.

4) To install ELSI as a library, run "make install".

5) Run "make check" will perform the regression test of ELSI.


B) If you already have some part of ELSI installed, you may choose to
   just build what you need.

   E.g. you have ELPA on your facility. You still need to build  libOMM, 
   PEXSI, and the ELSI interface. The process of installation could be 
   as follows:

1) Edit the file "make.sys".

1.1) Library directories
   Set the directory and include/lib path of ELPA, which you already have.
   Use the default settings for libOMM and PEXSI.

1.2) Global settings & ELSI-interface & libOMM & PEXSI
   SAME as described in A).

1.3) ELPA
   Do nothing.

2) PEXSI requires two external libraries: ParMETIS and SuperLU_DIST.
   Run "make external" to build these libraries.

3) Make sure your "make.sys" is correctly configured.

   Run "make libOMM", "make PEXSI", "make interface" to build them 
   one by one.

4) To install ELSI as a library, run "make install".

5) Run "make check" will perform the regression test of ELSI.
